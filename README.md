# Weather Journal
Project "Weather Journal App Project" for Udacity's Frontend Developer nanodegree program.

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.

Whichever section being actively viewed is stylized, and the corresponding navigation item will be highlighted. When a user clicks on a navigation item, the item will scroll to the appropriate section.

## How to Run
Simply open index.html in your browser.
